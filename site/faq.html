<title> Has Prospero been leaked yet? - FAQ </title>
</head>
<body>
<b> When will Prospero be leaked </b>
<p> We don't know. Soon... maybe.<br>
Where are the russian hackers when you need them?</p>
<b> What is Prospero? </b>
<p> Prospero is one of Valve's first games to be ever developed. It was cancelled so that the developers could get focused on developing Quiver (codename for Half-Life)<br>
To this day, only a handful of screenshots, some concept art and a single texture have seen the light of the day... <br>

<br>
<b> Why is Prospero important?</b>
<p> It would be interesting to see how does one of the first Valve games looked and played like. Also, it is the beta of betas, the cancelled game of the cut contents. <br>
Also, its a beytah!11!!! (maybe dark and gritty?!?!?) </p>
<b> Can I leak Prospero? </b>
<p> Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know.<br>
On one side, it would be cool if you could get your hands on the files. On the other side, hacking into Valve's servers and stealing data is probably a little bit illegal. <br>
If you can post the files before getting caught by the FBI... i'm not encouraging it, but if you manage to do so... </p>
<b> LEGAL DISCLAIMER: We are not responsible for any illegal activities that involve Prospero in some way. It is ultimately the reader's choice to hack into Valve's servers and steal data. </b>
