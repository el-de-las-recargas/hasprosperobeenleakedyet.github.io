<h3> A small database on all the information we have on Prospero </h3>

<h1> Half-Life Alpha v0.52 </h1>

<h3> Map entities </h3>
<p> The FGD file (a file that the level editor needs in order to know the entities of the game) of the leaked alpha version of Half-Life features some leftover entities from Prospero. </p>

<b> item_book </b>
<p> Leftover from an unknown demo, as pointed out by the comments. <br>
Since Prospero took place in a library, many theorize that it originally belonged to the game. </p>

<b> func_forcefield </b>
<p> Self-explanatory. It damages the player when touched, and it can be disabled (for a short time). Likely a Prospero leftover. </p>

<b> trigger_libraryportal </b>
<p> Similar entity to Half-Life's trigger_changelevel, except that it could change its targetname. <br>
It's likely that this entity would make traveling between libraries work.</p>

<h2> Misc </h2>

<p> The Half-Life Alpha v0.52 mentions Prospero on an unused credits image, as a registered Valve trademark. </p>

<br>
<i> It also mentions Quiver, an early name for Half-Life </i>
<br>
<br>
<b> Prdroid </b>
<p> On the tech demo, this droid is used to showcase Half-Life's skeletal animation system. <br>
It contains animations for attacking and dying, and given the nature of its design, it was likely meant for Prospero. </p>

<h1> Half-Life (Retail) </h1>

<h3> Music files </h3>
<p> Some of the soundtrack files in the media folder are named "Prospero0X" from 1 to 5. Given the fact that the rest of the soundtrack carries the "Half-LifeXX" name, these were reused/repurposed from Prospero. <br>
